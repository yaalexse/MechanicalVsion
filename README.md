## Motivation
In January 2024, as part of the experimental program "ALL4wALL – Smart ALLoys for WALLs: towards durable structures with long service lives and minimal seismic residual displacements," a 40-ton U-shaped reinforced concrete wall was tested under seismic excitation on the shaking table at the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) in Lisbon, Portugal.

This project aims to better understand the seismic behavior of U-shaped core walls made of reinforced concrete, which are commonly used for elevator shafts and stairwells in millions of buildings worldwide. The study focuses on two factors that generally contribute to poor structural response and weaken these walls after an earthquake: torsional effects and excessive residual displacements.

Researchers from ISAE-Supméca participated in these tests and performed measurements using high-resolution, medium-speed cameras. The post-processing of the videos and tracking of the markers drawn on the wall will help identify the overall dynamics of the structure. The use of image correlation techniques will also determine the deformation field and detect the presence of cracks.

The research team involved in the project comprises seven institutions: the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), ENPC ParisTech (France), ISAE-Supméca (France), the University of Liège (Belgium), the University of Ljubljana (Slovenia), the University of Pavia (Italy), and the University of York (Canada).
